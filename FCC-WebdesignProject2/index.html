          July 27 marks one of the most important days in diabetes treatment
          history. On that date in 1921, Dr. Frederick Banting, a Canadian
          surgeon and Charles Best, a medical student, successfully isolated the
          hormone insulin for the first time.

          The breakthrough research took place at the University of Toronto,
          where Banting and Best successfully isolated insulin from dogs,
          produced diabetes symptoms in the animals, and then provided insulin
          injections that produced normal blood glucose levels. Dr. Banting
          shared his success with Professor John Macleod.

        <h3>Insulin treatment begins for humans</h3>
        <p>
          Plans were quickly underway for an insulin treatment for people. Next,
          they extracted insulin from the pancreases of cattle from
          slaughterhouses. On January 11, 1922, 14-year-old Leonard Thompson
          became the first person to receive an insulin injection as treatment
          for diabetes. The first caused an allergic reaction. A refined process
          was quickly developed to improve the cow pancreas from which the
          insulin was derived, and Thompson's second dosage was successfully
          delivered twelve days later on January 23. The teenagerâ€™s condition
          improved dramatically. Diabetes, which had been regarded as a fatal
          disease, could finally be managed!

        <h3>Nobel Prize awarded to Banting and Macleod</h3>
        <p>
          By 1923, insulin had become widely available in mass production, and
          Banting and Macleod were awarded the Nobel Prize in medicine. Charles
          Best, being a graduate student, was not included. Banting recognized
          Best's involvement by sharing the award money.
